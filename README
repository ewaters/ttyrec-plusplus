NAME
    App::ttyrecpp - ttyrec++

SYNOPSIS
      $ ttyrec++

      .. do things in your shell ..

      $ exit
      Creating log ttyrec.12345.json

    or record the output of a particular program:

      $ ttyrec++ -- top

DESCRIPTION
    Kinda like "ttyrec" or "typescript", "ttyrec++" is a terminal recording
    program. It captures both the input and output of the slave TTY and
    writes out a JSON log file that's suitable for replaying in a web
    browser.
